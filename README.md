Build remote workspace index

This project appears to be a FastAPI-based web application with a PostgreSQL database, likely containerized using Docker. Here's a breakdown of what it does and how to run it:

### What the Project Does
1. **FastAPI Application**:
   - The main entry point is `main.py`, which initializes a FastAPI app.
   - It includes API routes from `apis.base.api_router`.
   - Middleware for CORS is added to allow cross-origin requests.

2. **Database Integration**:
   - The database tables are created using SQLAlchemy's `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` in the `create_tables` function.
   - The database engine is configured in `db.session`.

3. **Endpoints**:
   - `/`: Returns a welcome message (`{"msg": "Hello FastAPI🚀"}`).
   - `/userinfo`: Returns a default user object (`{"user_name": "Sumit Jain", "user_role": "Coding World Explorer"}`).

4. **Configuration**:
   - Settings like `PROJECT_NAME` and `PROJECT_VERSION` are loaded from `core.config.settings`.

### How to Run the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
   - Configure the database connection in `db.session` or the environment variables used in `core.config`.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the FastAPI server:
     ```sh
     uvicorn main:app --reload
     ```
   - This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

4. **Access the API**:
   - Open your browser or use a tool like `curl` or Postman to access:
     - `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` for the welcome message.
     - `http://127.0.0.1:8000/userinfo` for user info.

5. **Using Docker (if applicable)**:
   - If the project is containerized, check for a `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` in the workspace.
   - Build and run the container:
     ```sh
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

6. **Run Tests**:
   - If there are tests in the `tests/` directory, you can run them using `pytest`:
     ```sh
     pytest
     ```

To create the `BillsM` table in your database, you need to ensure that the SQLAlchemy `Base.metadata.create_all()` method is executed with the correct database engine. Based on your project structure, this is already handled in the `create_tables()` function in your main.py file.

### Steps to Create the Table:
1. **Ensure the Model is Imported**: Verify that the `BillsM` model is imported in the base.py file. This file should import all models to ensure they are registered with SQLAlchemy's `Base`. For example:
   ```python
   # filepath: /Users/sumitsontakke/Documents/Dev/fastapi-postgres-docker/db/base.py
   from db.models.bills import BillsM
   # Import other models here
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: Since the `create_tables()` function is called when the application starts, simply running the application will create the table. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 -m uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

3. **Verify Table Creation**: Check your database to confirm that the `BillsM` table has been created. You can use a database client or query the database directly.

### Alternative: Manual Table Creation
If you want to create the table without running the application, you can use a standalone script. For example:

```python
from db.base import Base
from db.session import engine

# Create all tables
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

Run the script with:
```bash
python3 create_tables.py
```
